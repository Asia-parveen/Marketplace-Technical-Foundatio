🎉 Marketplace Technical Foundation Day 4 Task Completed! 🚀

Day 4 Task: E-commerce Website Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS
Description:
In this task, I have developed a fully functional E-commerce Website using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS. The website is designed to provide an interactive user experience with a dynamic product listing and detailed product pages.make many reuseable componenets.

Key Features:
Next.js with TypeScript:

The website is built using Next.js, a React framework, for seamless server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The application is structured with TypeScript to enhance the development process with type safety.
Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, ensuring a highly customizable and responsive design for the e-commerce platform.
Sanity CMS:

Sanity CMS is integrated for content management, allowing easy management of product data. It is used to fetch product information dynamically, such as images, prices, and details, from a headless CMS.
Dynamic Routing:

I have implemented dynamic routing for product pages. Each product is displayed dynamically based on its unique ID, enabling a clean and scalable URL structure.
Reusable Components:

The website includes several reusable components, including a product card, product detail page, and product list. This modular approach ensures that the website is maintainable and easy to extend in the future.
Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure a consistent and smooth user experience across all devices.
Tasks Completed:
Product Listing Page: A dynamic product listing page that fetches data from Sanity CMS and displays products with their images, names, and prices.
Product Detail Page: Each product has its own dedicated page showing detailed information, including product images, description, and price.
Reusable Components: Components like product cards, buttons, and layouts are reusable, making the site easy to maintain and expand.
